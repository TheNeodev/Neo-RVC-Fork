## Features

- Minimize tone leakage with top1 retrieval replacing the source feature
- Quick and easy training, even on low-end GPUs
- Train with minimal data (recommend >=10min of low-noise speech)
- Model fusion for timbre variation (via ckpt processing tab->ckpt merge)
- User-friendly WebUI
- UVR5 model for efficient vocals and instrument separation
- High-pitch Voice Extraction Algorithm [InterSpeech2023-RMVPE](#Credits) for superior results with faster processing
- Support for AMD/Intel graphics card acceleration
- Intel ARC graphics card acceleration with IPEX support

## Environment Setup

Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed, then follow these steps:

1. Install main dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

2. Install additional dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry install
```

Or, use pip directly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/main.txt
pip install -r requirements/dml.txt  # for AMD/Intel graphics cards on Windows (DirectML)
pip install -r requirements/ipex.txt  # for Intel ARC graphics cards on Linux / WSL using Python 3.10
pip install -r requirements/amd.txt  # for AMD graphics cards on Linux (ROCm)
```

For Mac users:

```bash
sh ./run.sh
```

3. Download required pre-models:

```bash
python tools/download_models.py
```

Or manually download from our [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/tree/main/).

4. Install FFmpeg:

- For Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

- For MacOS:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

- For Windows, download and place `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` in the root folder.

## ROCm Support for AMD Graphics Cards (Linux)

For Linux users with AMD graphics cards, follow these steps:

1. Install required drivers as described [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/os-native/install.html).
2. For Arch, use pacman to install the driver:

```bash
pacman -S rocm-hip-sdk rocm-opencl-sdk
```

3. Set environment variables (e.g., on a RX6700XT):

```bash
export ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0
```

4. Ensure your user is part of the `render` and `video` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG render $USERNAME
sudo usermod -aG video $USERNAME
```

## Getting Started

### Direct Startup

Launch the WebUI with:

```bash
python infer-web.py
```

### Integration Package

1. Download and extract `RVC-beta.7z`.
2. Choose the appropriate script for your system:
   - For Windows, open `go-web.bat`.
   - For MacOS, run:

```bash
sh ./run.sh
```

### Intel IPEX Users (Linux Only)

```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```
